You and I moving in the dark
Bodies close but souls apart
Shadowed smiles, secrets unrevealed
I need to know the way you feel
I give you everything I am and
Everything I want to be
I put it in your hands

If you could open up to me, oh!
Can't we ever get beyond this wall?
Cause all I want is just once to see you in the light
But you hide behind the color of the night

I can't go on burning from the past
Love has torn away this mask
And all's like clouds, like rain
I'm drowning and I blame it all on you

I've lost. God, save me!
I give you everything I am and
Everything I want to be
I put it in your hands

If you could open up to me oh
Can't we ever get beyond this wall
Cause all I want is just once to see you in the light
But you hide behind the color of the night

God save me
everything I am and
Everything I want to be
Can't we ever get beyond this wall
Cause all I want is just once forever and again

I'm waiting for you
I'm standing in the light
But you hide behind the color of the night.
Please, come out from the color of the night
