You and I moving in the dark
Bodies close but souls apart
Shadowed smiles, secrets unrevealed
I need to know the way you feel
I give you everything I am and
Everything I want to be
I put it in your hands

If you could open up to me, oh!
Can't we ever get beyond this wall?
Cause all I want is just once to see you in the light
But you hide behind the color of the night

I can't go on burning from the past
Love has torn away this mask
And all's like clouds, like rain
I'm drowning and I blame it all on you

I've lost. God, save me!
I give you everything I am and
Everything I want to be
I put it in your hands

If you could open up to me oh
Can't we ever get beyond this wall
Cause all I want is just once to see you in the light
But you hide behind the color of the night
